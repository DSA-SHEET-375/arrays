arr-number of choclates in n packets
M-select any M such that diff b/w max and min 0f arr should be min
n-number of packets

class Solution:

    def findMinDiff(self, arr,n,M):

        # code here
        arr.sort()
        min_diff = arr[n-1] - arr[0]

            min_diff = min(min_diff ,  arr[i + M - 1] - arr[i])
        return min_diff
